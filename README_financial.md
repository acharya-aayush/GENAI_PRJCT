# Financial AI Fine-tuning with LLaMA 3.2

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune Meta's LLaMA 3.2 language model for financial sentiment analysis and market prediction using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). We've created a complete pipeline that can analyze financial news, predict market sentiment, and simulate trading strategies.

## Why This Project Matters

### The Problem
- Financial markets generate massive amounts of text data daily (news, reports, social media)
- Traditional sentiment analysis tools often miss nuanced financial context
- Human analysts can't process information at the speed and scale required for modern trading
- Generic AI models lack domain-specific financial knowledge

### Our Solution
- Fine-tune LLaMA 3.2 specifically for financial text understanding
- Use QLoRA to make training efficient and accessible on consumer hardware
- Create a complete pipeline from data processing to trading simulation
- Demonstrate practical applications in real financial scenarios

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **QLoRA Fine-tuning Pipeline**
   - Uses 4-bit quantization to reduce memory usage from 40GB+ to ~2GB
   - Applies Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only 1.33% of model parameters
   - Maintains model quality while dramatically reducing computational requirements

2. **Financial Data Processing**
   - Converts financial news into instruction-following format
   - Creates training examples with sentiment labels and explanations
   - Handles multiple data sources (Yahoo Finance, synthetic news data)

3. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Tests model performance on financial scenarios
   - Measures sentiment classification accuracy
   - Provides confidence scores and market impact predictions

4. **Backtesting System**
   - Simulates trading strategies based on AI predictions
   - Calculates portfolio performance metrics
   - Includes risk analysis and visualization tools

## What We Built

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
```python
# Example of our data format
{
    "instruction": "Analyze the sentiment of this financial news and predict market impact:",
    "input": "Apple reports record Q4 earnings, beating expectations by 15%",
    "output": "SENTIMENT: BULLISH\nCONFIDENCE: HIGH\nANALYSIS: Stock likely to rise 3-5% in next session"
}
```

**Why this format?**
- Instruction-following format helps the model understand the specific task
- Structured output makes predictions machine-readable for trading systems
- Confidence levels help with risk management decisions

### 2. Model Architecture Choices

**LLaMA 3.2 3B-Instruct**
- Pre-trained on diverse text including financial content
- Instruction-tuned for following specific prompts
- 3B parameters provide good balance of capability and efficiency

**QLoRA Configuration**
```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,                               # Rank of adaptation matrices
    lora_alpha=32,                      # Scaling factor
    target_modules=[
        "q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",  # Attention layers
        "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"      # MLP layers
    ],
    lora_dropout=0.1,                   # Regularization
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM
)
```

**Why these choices?**
- Rank 16 provides sufficient adaptation capacity without overfitting
- Targeting both attention and MLP layers captures different types of patterns
- Low dropout (0.1) preserves learned financial knowledge

### 3. Training Strategy

**Data Augmentation**
- Created diverse financial scenarios (earnings, market events, sector news)
- Balanced sentiment distribution (bullish, bearish, neutral)
- Added reasoning explanations to improve model transparency

**Training Parameters**
- Small batch size (1) with gradient accumulation (4) for memory efficiency
- Low learning rate (2e-4) to avoid catastrophic forgetting
- 3 epochs to prevent overfitting on small dataset

### 4. Evaluation and Testing

**Test Cases**
- Real-world financial scenarios
- Mixed sentiment examples
- Different confidence levels
- Various market sectors

**Performance Metrics**
- Sentiment classification accuracy
- Confidence calibration
- Market impact prediction quality
- Trading strategy profitability simulation

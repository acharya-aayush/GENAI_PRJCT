# ChitraGupta - Project Documentation

This is the full documentation for our ChitraGupta project. We built this during our Gen AI workshop because starting a business in Nepal is honestly super complicated - too many rules, unclear requirements, and expensive consultants.

## The Problem

When I (Aayush) was looking into starting my own side business, I spent weeks trying to figure out basic stuff like:
- What's the actual VAT rate?
- When do I need to register for VAT?
- How much does company registration cost?
- What licenses do I need?

Google just gave generic answers. Lawyers are expensive. Government websites are... well, you know how government websites are.

## Our Solution

So we thought - what if we could build an AI that actually knows Nepal's laws? Not generic business advice, but the real deal. 

We took 400+ pages of official Nepal government documents (Income Tax Rules 2059, VAT regulations, etc.), processed them into a searchable format, and connected them to LLaMA. Now you can ask specific questions and get answers with actual citations.

It's like having a business lawyer who:
- Never charges by the hour
- Actually knows current Nepal laws
- Is available 24/7
- Can cite exact articles and sections

## Technical Implementation

### The Stack

We went with:
- **LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct** - Good enough for our needs, runs locally
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** - The secret sauce
- **Flask** - Keep it simple
- **FAISS** - Fast document search
- **Sentence Transformers** - For turning text into vectors

### Why LLaMA 3.2 3B?

Honestly, we tried bigger models first. But:
- They're huge (would need expensive GPUs)
- Slower inference
- Overkill for our specific domain

3B parameters is the sweet spot. With 4-bit quantization, it runs on my gaming laptop (RTX 3060) just fine.

### The RAG Approach

This was the game changer. Instead of fine-tuning (expensive and time-consuming), we went with RAG:

1. **Store documents**: Split all legal docs into chunks, turn them into vectors
2. **Search**: When user asks a question, find the most relevant document chunks  
3. **Generate**: Give LLaMA the question + relevant documents, let it craft the answer

This way the AI isn't guessing - it's reading actual legal documents and summarizing them.

## How It Works (The Pipeline)

When you ask "What's the VAT rate in Nepal?":

1. **Convert question to vector** - We use sentence transformers to turn your text into numbers (384 dimensions)

2. **Search documents** - FAISS finds the 5 most similar document chunks from our database of 1,402 legal text pieces

3. **Build context** - Combine your question + relevant legal docs + some business data into one prompt

4. **AI generates answer** - LLaMA reads everything and writes a response with citations

5. **Show result** - You get an answer like "VAT rate is 13%. According to Article X of Nepal Income Tax Rules..."

Takes about 30-60 seconds total. Most of that is LLaMA thinking, not the search (which is under 1ms).

## The Data Collection Process

This was honestly the hardest part. We needed official, accurate documents.

**Legal Documents:**
- Nepal Income Tax Rules 2059 (the main one - 400+ pages)
- VAT regulations  
- Company registration procedures
- Banking guidelines
- Industry-specific rules

**Processing:**
1. Extract text from PDFs (some were scanned, had to OCR)
2. Split into chunks (around 200-500 words each)
3. Clean formatting, remove headers/footers
4. Add metadata (which article, which section, etc.)
5. Generate embeddings for each chunk

**Business Data:**
We also collected current rates and industry benchmarks:
- Tax rates (corporate 25%, manufacturing 20%, etc.)
- Registration costs and thresholds
- Industry-specific margins and capital requirements

End result: 1,402 document chunks covering most business scenarios in Nepal.

## Technical Deep Dive

### RAG System Explained

RAG = Retrieval Augmented Generation. It's like giving the AI a really good research assistant.

**Without RAG**: AI just guesses based on its training (often wrong for specific domains)
**With RAG**: AI first looks up relevant documents, then answers based on facts

Our RAG pipeline:
1. **Document Processing**: Split legal docs into semantic chunks
2. **Embedding**: Convert chunks to vectors using sentence-BERT
3. **Indexing**: Store in FAISS for lightning-fast search
4. **Retrieval**: Find most similar chunks for any query
5. **Generation**: LLaMA generates answer with context

### Memory Optimization

Original LLaMA 3.2 3B = 6.4GB RAM (too much!)
Our quantized version = 1.6GB RAM (75% reduction!)

We used 4-bit quantization which basically stores the model weights more efficiently while keeping 95% of the original performance.

### Performance Stats

- **Response time**: 30-60 seconds (comprehensive business advice)
- **Search time**: <1 millisecond (finding relevant documents)
- **Memory usage**: 2.2GB total (model + data)
- **Accuracy**: 60% overall (100% for tax rates and business planning)

## Web Interface

Super simple chat interface:
- Type your question
- Get detailed answer with sources
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Professional Nepal business branding

The backend serves everything through Flask:
- `POST /chat` - main endpoint for questions
- `GET /` - serves the chat interface
- `GET /static/*` - CSS, JS, images

## Team & Development

**Team Members:**
- **Aayush Acharya** (@acharya.404) - Main developer, AI implementation
- **Nidhi Pradhan** - Business analysis, testing
- **Suravi Paudel** - Data collection, documentation

**Mentor:** Er. Sujan Sharma

**Development Process:**
1. Research phase - studied Nepal business requirements
2. Data collection - gathered official government documents
3. AI implementation - set up LLaMA + RAG system
4. Testing - validated with real business scenarios
5. Web interface - created user-friendly chat system

## Challenges We Actually Faced

**Memory Issues**: LLaMA models are huge. The original 3.2B model needs 6.4GB RAM. My laptop has 16GB total, so running anything else became impossible. Solution: 4-bit quantization reduced it to 1.6GB with minimal quality loss.

**Context Window Limits**: LLaMA can only handle about 2000 input tokens. With legal documents being long, we had to be smart about which chunks to include. We prioritize by similarity score and cut off at the token limit.

**Accuracy vs Speed**: Initially responses took 2+ minutes. We optimized by:
- Better chunking strategy
- Smarter context selection  
- Quantization for faster inference
- Now it's 30-60 seconds which is acceptable

**Hallucinations**: AI models love making stuff up. Our approach:
- Always provide source documents
- Use low temperature (0.2) for more focused responses
- Explicitly tell the model to cite sources
- Include "say I don't know if unsure" in prompts

**Data Quality**: Government PDFs are a mess. Some were scanned images, inconsistent formatting, etc. Spent a lot of time cleaning and validating the extracted text.

## Real Performance Numbers

**Response Time**: 30-60 seconds (depends on question complexity)
**Search Speed**: <1ms to find relevant documents
**Memory Usage**: 2.2GB total (1.6GB model + 600MB for embeddings/data)
**Accuracy**: 
- Tax rates/thresholds: 100% (these are facts)
- Business planning: ~90% (good practical advice)
- Edge cases: ~40% (model admits uncertainty)
- Overall: ~60% which is solid for this domain

**Throughput**: Can handle 10-20 queries per minute on my laptop

## What Makes This Project Cool

1. **Real Impact**: Solves actual problems for Nepal entrepreneurs
2. **Technical Innovation**: Proper RAG implementation with local LLaMA
3. **Domain Expertise**: Built on 400+ pages of actual legal documents
4. **Practical**: Actually works and gives useful advice
5. **Local**: No external APIs, complete privacy

## Why This Project Matters

**For Nepal**: Business information is scattered, outdated, or behind paywalls. This democratizes access to legal/financial knowledge.

**For Us**: We learned a ton about production AI systems. RAG is way more practical than fine-tuning for domain-specific applications.

**For Users**: Instead of paying Rs. 5000+ to a consultant for basic questions, you get instant expert-level advice.

## Example Conversations

**Q: "I want to start an electronics store. What do I need to know?"**

**A: "For electronics retail in Nepal, you'll need:

**Business Registration**: Company registration costs Rs. 1,500-5,000 depending on capital. If your projected annual turnover exceeds Rs. 50 lakh, register for VAT (Rs. 500 fee).

**Capital Requirements**: Small electronics stores typically need 10-25 lakh capital. Industry average margin is 18% with warranty costs around 3%.

**Licenses**: Trade license from municipality (Rs. 200-2,000), plus VAT registration if applicable.

**Tax Obligations**: Corporate tax 25%, VAT 13% on sales. TDS applies at 0.15% on goods.

**Sources**: Nepal Income Tax Rules 2059, Article 15; Municipal Trade License Act..."**

---

**Q: "What's the difference between VAT and TDS?"**

**A: "VAT (Value Added Tax) and TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) are different:

**VAT**: 13% tax on goods/services. You collect it from customers and pay to government. Required if annual turnover > Rs. 50 lakh.

**TDS**: Tax deducted at source. Banks/companies deduct tax when paying you. Rates: 1.5% on services, 0.15% on goods.

**Key difference**: VAT you collect from others, TDS others deduct from your payments.

**Sources**: VAT Act 2052, TDS provisions in Income Tax Act..."**

Much better than generic Google results, right?

## Future Improvements

- **Multilingual**: Add Nepali language support
- **Real-time updates**: Auto-update when laws change
- **More domains**: Add agriculture, tourism, etc.
- **Mobile app**: Native mobile version
- **Voice interface**: Talk to ChitraGupta
- **User accounts**: Save conversation history

## Technical Deep Dive (For the Nerds)

### Model Specs
- **Base Model**: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
- **Quantization**: 4-bit NF4 using BitsAndBytesConfig
- **Memory**: 1.6GB (down from 6.4GB original)
- **Generation**: Temperature 0.2, Top-p 0.85, Max tokens 1024

### RAG Implementation
```python
# Simplified version of our pipeline
def get_answer(question):
    # 1. Convert question to vector
    query_embedding = embedding_model.encode([question])
    
    # 2. Search similar documents  
    scores, indices = faiss_index.search(query_embedding, k=5)
    relevant_docs = [chunks[i] for i in indices[0]]
    
    # 3. Build prompt
    context = "\n".join(relevant_docs)
    prompt = f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"
    
    # 4. Generate response
    response = llama_model.generate(prompt)
    return response
```

- **AI tier**: GPU instances for model inference  
- **Data tier**: PostgreSQL for sessions, Redis for caching
- **Storage**: S3/equivalent for documents and models

## What We'd Do Differently

**If we started over:**
1. **Better data collection process** - more structured approach to document ingestion
2. **Evaluation framework** - systematic way to test accuracy across different question types
3. **User feedback loop** - learn from actual usage patterns
4. **Hybrid search** - combine semantic search with keyword matching
5. **Better chunking** - experiment with different strategies (by topic, legal section, etc.)

**Future improvements:**
- Nepali language support (challenge: limited Nepali legal corpus)
- Real-time updates when laws change
- Integration with actual government APIs
- Mobile app for easier access
- Voice interface (speak questions, get audio responses)

## Common Questions We Get

**Q: Why not just use ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT gives generic business advice. It doesn't know that VAT registration in Nepal costs Rs. 500 or that the threshold is Rs. 50 lakh. Our system knows the actual current laws.

**Q: How accurate is it really?**
A: For factual stuff (tax rates, thresholds, procedures) - very accurate because it's reading from official documents. For subjective advice (should you start this business?) - decent but not perfect. We're conservative about accuracy.

**Q: Could you fine-tune instead of RAG?**
A: Technically yes, but RAG is better for our use case:
- Can update knowledge without retraining
- Transparent (shows source documents)
- Cheaper to maintain
- Better for specific domain knowledge

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: Everything runs locally. No data sent to external APIs. Your questions never leave your computer.

**Q: How did you validate the legal documents?**
A: Cross-referenced multiple official sources, manual verification of key facts (tax rates, etc.), and tested against known scenarios. Not 100% perfect but way better than generic AI.

**Q: Why Flask instead of something modern?**
A: Keep it simple. Flask gets the job done, easy to understand and modify. We're not building Facebook here.

**Q: Performance on different hardware?**
A: Tested on RTX 3060 (good), RTX 4070 (better), and CPU-only (slow but works). 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended.

## The Business Case

**Problem size**: Nepal has 500,000+ registered businesses, most lack proper financial guidance

**Market gap**: Consultants charge Rs. 5,000+ per session, government resources are hard to navigate

**Our solution**: Democratize access to business guidance through AI

**Potential impact**: Could help thousands of entrepreneurs get started properly

**Revenue model** (if we wanted to monetize):
- Freemium (basic questions free, advanced features paid)
- B2B licensing to banks, incubators, government
- White-label for business consultants

But honestly, we built this to solve a real problem, not to get rich.

## Project Stats

**Development time**: ~6 weeks part-time
**Lines of code**: ~2,000 (including data processing)
**Documents processed**: 400+ pages of legal text
**Final dataset**: 1,402 chunks, 384-dim embeddings
**Model size**: 3.2B parameters (1.6GB quantized)
**Accuracy on core questions**: 60% overall, 100% on factual queries

## Conclusion

This project shows that you can build useful AI applications without massive resources. By focusing on a specific domain (Nepal business law) and using smart techniques (RAG), we created something that genuinely helps people.

The key insight: AI is most powerful when it has access to specific, verified information. Generic models are good at language, but domain expertise comes from good data and smart retrieval.

ChitraGupta won't replace business consultants, but it can handle 80% of common questions instantly and for free. That's pretty valuable for entrepreneurs just getting started.

**Current status**: Working prototype, handles most common business questions
**Next steps**: Gather user feedback, expand document coverage, improve accuracy
**Long-term vision**: The go-to resource for business guidance in Nepal

---

## Embeddings & Vector Search

### Embedding Model Choice
**Selected**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Pros**: Fast, good quality, 384 dimensions
- **Cons**: English-only (acceptable for Nepal's bilingual context)
- **Alternatives considered**: multilingual models (slower, larger)

### Vector Search Process
1. **Query Embedding**: Convert user query to 384-dim vector
2. **Similarity Search**: Find top-k most similar document chunks
3. **Score Threshold**: Filter results with similarity > 0.3
4. **Context Assembly**: Combine retrieved chunks for LLaMA

### FAISS Configuration
```python
# Index configuration
index_type = "IndexFlatIP"  # Exact search for accuracy
metric = "INNER_PRODUCT"    # Cosine similarity equivalent
dimension = 384             # Embedding size
```

---

## Prompt Engineering

### System Prompt Design
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a financial advisor specializing in Nepal's business environment.
Use the provided legal documents and financial data to give accurate advice.

CONTEXT: {retrieved_documents}

RULES:
1. Always cite specific laws/documents when relevant
2. Provide exact numbers (tax rates, thresholds)
3. Give actionable steps
4. Be conversational but professional
5. If unsure, say so and suggest consulting a lawyer

USER QUESTION: {user_query}

RESPONSE:"""
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategies

#### 1. Context Integration
- Inject retrieved documents into prompt
- Limit context to 2000 tokens (model's context window)
- Prioritize most relevant chunks

#### 2. Few-shot Examples
```python
EXAMPLES = """
Example 1:
Q: Do I need VAT registration?
A: VAT registration is required if your annual turnover exceeds NPR 5,000,000...

Example 2:
Q: What's the corporate tax rate?
A: Corporate tax in Nepal is 25% for general businesses, 20% for manufacturing...
"""
```

#### 3. Output Formatting
```python
OUTPUT_FORMAT = """
Structure your response as:
1. DIRECT ANSWER (2-3 sentences)
2. DETAILED EXPLANATION (with specific numbers)
3. ACTIONABLE STEPS (3-5 bullet points)
4. LEGAL REFERENCES (cite relevant documents)
"""
```

---

## Model Integration

## Common Defense Questions & Answers

### RAG Fundamentals

**Q: What is RAG and why did you choose it?**
A: RAG combines retrieval and generation. We retrieve relevant documents from our Nepal legal database, then use LLaMA to generate responses based on that context. This ensures accurate, up-to-date information specific to Nepal's laws and regulations.

**Q: What are the alternatives to RAG?**
A: Alternatives include:
1. **Fine-tuning**: Expensive, requires retraining for updates

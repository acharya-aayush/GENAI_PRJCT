## What is this?

ChitraGupta is a chatbot that can answer business questions specific to Nepal. Instead of generic advice, it knows actual Nepal tax laws, VAT rates, registration requirements, etc. because we trained it on 400+ pages of official government documents.

## Quick Demo

**You:** "What's the VAT threshold in Nepal?"  
**ChitraGupta:** "VAT registration is required if your annual turnover exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. According to Nepal Income Tax Rules 2059, Article 15..."

**You:** "How much capital for a clothing store?"  
**ChitraGupta:** "Small clothing store: 5-15 lakh (25% margin), Medium: 15-50 lakh (30% margin). Peak seasons are Dashain and Tihar..."

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` and start asking questions.

*Note: First run downloads the AI model (~3GB). After that, everything runs offline.*

## Tech Stack

- **LLaMA 3.2 3B** (4-bit quantized to fit on normal computers)
- **RAG system** (finds relevant legal docs before answering)
- **FAISS** (super fast document search)
- **Flask** (simple web interface)

## Why This?

Instead of just asking AI to guess, we:
1. Find the most relevant legal documents for your question
2. Give those documents + your question to the AI
3. AI answers based on actual facts, not hallucinations

## What Makes This Special

Most AI chatbots give generic business advice. ChitraGupta knows Nepal's specific laws, current tax rates (2025), and industry benchmarks. It's like having a Nepalese business consultant that never sleeps.
